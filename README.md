# Number Guessing Game - A Journey of Luck and OOPs Concepts

Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte Java Internship project repository! üéâ In this exciting project, I present you with a thrilling Number Guessing Game, where the randomness of luck plays a significant role. Prepare yourself for a challenging yet fun-filled experience as you embark on this journey of uncertainty.

## Project Description

The Number Guessing Game is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts, showcasing the essence of inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. It comprises two key classes, Round 1 and Round 2, each with its unique set of rules and challenges.

### How the Game Works

1. **Round 1:** The player starts by attempting to guess the secret number within a limited number of attempts. Successfully passing Round 1 will unlock the next level, promising an even more exciting Round 2.

2. **Round 2:** In this advanced round, the player's skills will be put to the ultimate test. Correctly guessing the secret number within the given attempts will lead to the ultimate victory, proving that "Luck is Random."

### OOPs Concepts Implementation

This project showcases the beauty of Object-Oriented Programming with the following key features:

- **Inheritance:** The classes Round 1 and Round 2 inherit and extend common functionalities from a base class, optimizing code reusability and organization.

- **Encapsulation:** Critical game components and functionalities are encapsulated within classes, ensuring data integrity and secure access control.

- **Abstraction:** By abstracting underlying implementations, the project promotes a clear distinction between user interaction and backend logic, enhancing code maintainability.
